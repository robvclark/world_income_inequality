World Income Inequality

The World Income Inequality database features mean and median national incomes based on net national income (NNI), gross domestic product (GDP), and household final consumption expenditure (HFCE).  The NNI and GDP data cover 123 countries during the 1990 – 2017 period.  The HFCE data are reported separately and cover 100 countries during the 1996 – 2017 period (see HFCE.dta).  Population weights are included.  The dataset also reports national inequality data, including each country’s Gini (from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database), as well as the Theil (converted from the Gini).  Median incomes for each country are generated using its mean income and the Gini, with data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) serving as the baseline (see LIS.dta).
